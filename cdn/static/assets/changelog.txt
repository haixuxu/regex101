## Version 5.0.0 - 22th of January, 2021

1. Rewrote entire backend to improve performance

2. Reworked the account page; titles and tags are now associated with the entire
permalink and not a specific version.

3. Redesigned the save modal, it now shows the account information (if signed in) in the same view,
and makes it easier to work with.

4. Switched to new icons throughout the entire application

5. Slight modifications to the general look and feel, such as flatter buttons and larger font sizes.

6. Added support for PCRE2

7. Dropped support for legacy browsers, approximately the following versions: Internet Explorer, Firefox <55, Chrome <60, Edge <16

8. Reworked library entries: a permalink is now permanently associated with an account and the
entry, and the owner can whenever they want update the version of that permalink which will reflect
in the library. Hopefully this is not going to be abused, but if it is, the library will always
default to the first version and never allow for an update.

9. Titles and tags are now associated with the entire permalink and all versions within it.

10. The default save functionality of the website has been changed, now a new permalink is created
by default (using ctrl+s) and an update of the current workspace has to be explicit,
by either clicking the menu item or using ctrl+shift+s.

11. The regex quiz now utilizes the PCRE2 engine instead of PCRE1.
Can you exploit this to your advantage?

12. Multiple dependencies has been updated, which has resulted in a lot of behind-the-scenes work.
This has resulted in general performance improvements, but nothing you are likely to experience.

13. Squashed 20-30 different edge case bugs in the app and regex tokenizer.
I will outline fixes of this nature in the future, but for now, take my word for it.

14. The supported Python version is now indicated in the sidebar

15. Reorganized settings

16. Added a new setting that allows you to conditionally turn on/off step counting in supported
flavors. This can dramatically improve performance in complex expressions.

17. Fixed key binding bug which would present itself in the debugger.

18. Added more tests to multiple quiz tasks.

19. Implemented surgical fix to avoid odd tabbing behavior in debugger (and other similar modals)

20. Added support for the # delimiter.

21. Due to 2 and 8, the database had to be modified, and data had to be migrated.
Some loss of data is to be expected, since not all the information from the previous model could
fit in the new one, but there are extremely few individuals affected.
This only affects titles and tags, not any saved expressions.

22. Fixed autoit code generator

23. Fixed parsing and validation of surrogate pairs in the editor

24. Added a "whats new" button to the header

25. Revised contrast of dark theme

26. Increased font sizes slightly

27. Improved performance of tooltips in the editor (and possible squashed a few bugs that would cause the app to crash)

28. Rewrote large parts of the editor page (front page) and the regex parser. Hopefully I have not introduced (too many) new bugs...

29. Substitution area has received some love. A new indicator was added, similar to the match functionality.

30. Added PCRE2 native substitution (and the new syntax).

31. Fixed bug with `\b` in substitution
